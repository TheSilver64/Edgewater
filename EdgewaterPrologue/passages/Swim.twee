::Swim

<<type 20ms>>\
You swim towards it.

The silver floats in the water. It's a nightgown - your mother's nightgown! 
She drifts, her back turned to you. Her hair fans outwards in the water.

You finally reach her.

“Mom!” your words garble.

You grab her shoulders and turn her around. 
The bloated face of a corpse stares back at you. Her eyes are milky white, unseeing.

[[You scream -> aLonelyRide]]
