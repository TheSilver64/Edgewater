:: Lightning

<<type 20ms>>\
Lightning flashes, illuminating everything. You realize now why you didn’t recognize her before. 
She stares at you with wide, bloodshot eyes. Like she’s a deer staring down the barrel of a rifle.

Her silver nightgown is drenched in blood.

Thunder shakes the house–the door slams–

And she’s gone.
