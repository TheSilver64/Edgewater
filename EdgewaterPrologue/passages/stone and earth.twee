"A sharp cry awakens you. You hear a thump and a thud. Your eyes fly open. 
Your room is pitch black. The sky is obscured by brewing stormclouds. 
They rumble, a low deep sound that penetrates the floorboards.

You tiptoe barefoot across down the stairs. One step at a time, quietly, delicately. 
One wrong movement and the groans of the old house’s bones would alert your parents. "

"Another cry–loud, piercing. In pain. Agonizing. More thumps. 
Your father’s voice–low, angry. Then desperate, pleading. "
