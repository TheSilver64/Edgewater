You talk about igneous and sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. About how pressure and heat transform one thing into another over millions and millions and millions of years. About crystals forming in regular, repeating patterns. About how you can read the history of the Earth through its layers of stone. 

Dove listens with rapt attention, even though you suspect she doesn't understand half of what you're saying. She just sits, cross-legged on the floor, Marcus in her lap, staring doe-eyed up at you. Every once in a while she shakes away her dreamy gaze to nod at appropriate moments.  

It feels good to talk about something concrete. Something that makes sense. That follows rules.

As you speak, your eyes wander across the walls. They're covered in drawings—large sheets of A4 poster paper tacked up with thumbtacks, overlapping in places like scales. You hadn’t noticed them before–the ceiling was too distracting. 

On the left side, crayon drawings in a younger style: four stick figures holding hands. Two boys and two girls: Dad, you, Winona, and Dove. Smiling suns and flowers frame them.

On the right side, the drawings are more recent. Only three figures, rendered with more skill but less joy. The colors are darker. The lines are more careful, more controlled.

And scattered among them—maybe a dozen in total—drawings of a wolf.
