And so you do. You talk about igneous and sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. About how pressure and heat transform one thing into another over millions and millions and millions of years. About crystals forming in regular, repeating patterns. About how you can read the history of the Earth through its layers of stone. 

Dove listens with rapt attention, even though you suspect she doesn't understand half of what you're saying. She just sits, cross-legged on the floor, Marcus in her lap, staring doe-eyed up at you. Every once in a while she shakes away her dreamy gaze to nod at appropriate moments.  

It feels good to talk about something concrete. Something that makes sense. That follows rules.

As you speak, your eyes wander across the walls. They're covered in drawings—large sheets of A4 poster paper tacked up with thumbtacks, overlapping in places like scales. You hadn’t noticed them before–the ceiling was too distracting. 

On the left side, crayon drawings in a younger style: four stick figures holding hands. Two boys and two girls: Dad, you, Winona, and Dove. Smiling suns and flowers frame them.

On the right side, the drawings are more recent. Only three figures, rendered with more skill but less joy. The colors are darker. The lines are more careful, more controlled.

And scattered among them—maybe a dozen in total—drawings of a wolf.

<span class="scary">A black wolf.</span>

Your voice trails off mid-sentence about sedimentary layers. The wolf is rendered in black crayon, pressed so hard the wax has built up in thick, waxy ridges. Red eyes. Fangs bared in every image, left white against the black. In some drawings it's standing. In others, crouched. Ready to pounce.

But in one drawing near the window, the wolf sits peacefully beside another figure—a boy, rendered in softer strokes. Brown hair. Smiling. They're sitting side by side like companions. The boy has his arm around the wolf's neck.

<span class="arthur">"...so that's how you can tell the age of different rock formations,"</span> you finish weakly, still transfixed by the image.

Dove senses the shift in your attention. She follows your gaze to the wall.

<span class="arthur">"Hey,"</span> you say carefully, keeping your tone light. <span class="arthur">"I'm looking at your pictures. Who's that boy? The one with the wolf?"</span>

<span class="dove">"Oh, that's my friend!"</span> Dove says brightly, as if it's the most natural thing in the world. <span class="dove">"He plays with me sometimes. He's really nice. He's not scared of the wolf at all—he can tame him, actually."</span>

A chill runs down your spine, but you keep your voice casual. Does Winona know about these delusions?

 <span class="arthur">“Does your friend have a name?"</span>

Dove shrugs. <span class="dove">"I just call him Friend,"</span> she says. <span class="dove">“He doesn't talk much, but he's good at games. Hide and seek, mostly. He protects me from the wolf during the day."</span> Then her expression darkens. <span class="dove">"But at night, the wolf... he's different in my dreams. He's not nice like in the picture."</span>

<span class="arthur">"Dreams?"</span> You crouch down to her level. <span class="arthur">"What kind of dreams?"</span>

Dove's hands tighten around Marcus. Her voice becomes small, younger than her ten years.

<span class="dove">"At first he had a rabbit in his mouth."</span> She's staring down at the stone now, not meeting your eyes. <span class="dove">"Just a little baby rabbit. But then..."</span> Her voice drops to barely a whisper. <span class="dove">"Then it was…</span>
<span class="super-scary"> Daddy's head."</span>

Your blood turns to ice.

<span class="dove">"I was so scared,"</span> Dove continues. <span class="dove">"I told Winona, but she just said they're nightmares. That they're not real. But they feel real, Arty. They always feel real. That's why she keeps making me more dreamcatchers."</span> She glances up at the ceiling, at the web of protection Winona has woven for her. 

<span class="dove">"Sometimes they work. This time they didn’t, because then–”</span> her hands tremble around the stone, <span class="dove">“then Daddy died-!”</span> 

You place your hand on her shoulder. <span class="arthur">"Hey. Look at me."</span>

She looks up, and you can see the fear in her wide eyes.

<span class="arthur">"Don't worry,"</span> you say, forcing confidence into your voice. <span class="arthur">"I'm like King Arthur. You know him?"</span>

She shakes her head, confused. <span class="dove">"No?"</span>

<span class="arthur">"Well, he's a brave guy from the stories."</span> You sit down fully, crossing your legs. <span class="arthur">"He rode around on a horse—well, actually, he pretended to ride a horse while his servant banged coconuts together. And he fought a terrible rabbit that could kill people with its fangs. And he went searching for a holy grail that—"</span>

You tell her the plot of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, making it as silly and absurd as possible. By the time you get to the part about the Knights who say “Ni,” Dove is giggling.

<span class="dove">"Wow!"</span> She jumps to her feet. <span class="dove">"Tell me another story!"</span>

<span class="arthur">"Another time,"</span> you promise. <span class="arthur">"Why don't you show me the rest of your collection?"</span>

The afternoon light is beginning to fade when you finally stand, your legs stiff from sitting on the floor. The dreamcatchers cast increasingly deep, overlapping shadows across the walls as they turn.

<span class="arthur">"I should probably go check on Winona,"</span> you say reluctantly.

Dove's face falls. <span class="dove">"Already? But you just got here!"</span>

<span class="arthur">"I'll be back later,”</span> you promise. <span class="arthur">"And maybe tomorrow, we can go collect more treasures, if the weather's nice."</span>

Her face brightens immediately. <span class="dove">"Really? You promise? Will you meet Friend? He'd like you, I think."</span>

The casual way she says it makes your skin prickle. <span class="arthur">"...Maybe,"</span> you say. 

She throws her arms around you again. Over her head, you can see the black wolf drawings on the wall. Their red eyes seem to follow you in the dimming light.

You hold your sister close and try not to think about what kind of nightmares would make a ten-year-old draw the same monster over and over again.

You try not to think about your own nightmares. Water. Blood. Silver silk in the moonlight. 

And now, your father's head dangling from a [[wolf's jaws.->Ch4Pg0]]
