Winona stands on the second step, one hand on the banister. She's wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans, her auburn hair loose and disheveled around her shoulders. At twenty, she's grown into someone you almost don't recognize. Her face is sharper, and there’s a hardness around the eyes that wasn’t there before. 

She doesn’t smile. Just watches you with an unreadable expression. Her lips are pursed in a thin line. 

<span class="winona">“Four years,”</span> she says finally. <span class="winona">“Four years and now you decide to show up.”</span>

Your mouth is dry. <span class="arthur">“Winny, I…”</span> your voice cracks, then falters. Every ounce of pretend courage you’d summoned is gone. 

<span class="winona">“Save it. Come inside. Dove,”</span> Winona sighs, <span class="winona">“let him breathe.”</span>

[[Go inside.->Ch3Pg7]]
