It echoes, reverberating down to the house’s foundation. 

A moment passes.

Then frantic footsteps from above. They scrabble, pause, before you hear the sound of bare feet smacking the stairs, and the thump, thump, thump following each impact.

A muffled voice sounds through the wood, high and excited. 

<span class="dove">“Arty!”</span>

The door swings open, groaning on its rusty hinges. 

And there she is.

Dove.

She's so much bigger than you remember. Not the little girl you left behind, but ten years old now, tall and gangly in that pre-adolescent way. Her hair is the same black as your mother's, cut bluntly across her forehead in bangs and tucked behind her in two messy braids. Her eyes are bright with excitement. 

<span class="dove">"Arty! Arty! Arty! You're back! You're back! You're back!"</span>

She gasps, collecting her energy, before using the last of her momentum to launch herself at you. She collides with you before you’ve fully crossed the threshold, tumbling forward. You stand frozen for a moment. Then your arms moved of their own accord, grasping her back and steadying her small frame. She wraps her thin arms around your waist–she’s tall enough to reach that high–and squeezes weakly. 

<span class="arthur">“Hey, Dove,”</span> you say softly. She smells like kid shampoo.

She wiggles in your embrace. <span class="dove">“You’re back you’re back you’re back!”</span> 

<span class="arthur">“Yeah,”</span> you manage, voice thick. <span class="arthur">“I’m back.”</span> 

Over Dove's head, you see the interior of the house. It’s much like you remember–the mounted TV above the shelves of books, their spines well-worn. The leather sofa opposite it, bearing the deep impressions of bodies that have sat there for too long, for too often. Beneath it, a fuzzy rug that looks softer than it is.

The light pink wallpaper bubbles and peels, the floral patterns that once adorned it faded into obscure blobs.

The lake dominates the far wall, just barely visible through those murky windows. The dirt makes the water look darker than you remember, more sinister. Beyond the windows, you can make out the outline of the bistro table in the sunroom beyond.

Much the same, just older.

But the dining table. 

It's covered in papers. Legal documents. Folders creased from repeated handling. Long loose strands of dark auburn hair catch the light—Winona's hair, you recognize with a start. All four chairs but one are pulled out, as if the people sitting there left in a hurry and never returned.

You shake yourself out of your reverie. 

<span class="arthur">"You're so big now!"</span> you say to Dove, injecting enthusiasm into your voice. Trying to be the brother she remembers. <span class="arthur">"Wow, you're no dove anymore—you're a bald eagle!"</span>

<span class="dove">“I’m not bald!”</span> Dove protests, pulling back to pound your arms with her small fists. The blows are light, playful, but each one lands like an accusation. <span class="dove">“You were gone so long I thought I was gonna die waiting! But you’re back for good? You finished college? You can play with me now?”</span> She looks up with puppy-dog eyes. 

<span class="arthur">“Not quite done yet, but we can play now if you want.”</span>

Dove squeals. <span class="dove">“Okay! I’ll give you a tour of the house, in case you forgot!”</span> 

She tugs on your sleeves, and you begin to follow, but another set of feet on the stairs makes you stop short.

You look up.

Winona stands on the second step, one hand on the banister. She's wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans, her auburn hair loose and disheveled around her shoulders. At twenty, she's grown into someone you almost don't recognize. Her face is sharper, and there’s a hardness around the eyes that wasn’t there before. 

She doesn’t smile. Just watches you with an unreadable expression. Her lips are pursed in a thin line. 

<span class="winona">“Four years,”</span> she says finally. <span class="winona">“Four years and now you decide to show up.”</span>

Your mouth is dry. <span class="arthur">“Winny, I…”</span> your voice cracks, then falters. Every ounce of pretend courage you’d summoned is gone. 

<span class="winona">“Save it. Come inside. Dove,”</span> Winona sighs, <span class="winona">“let him breathe.”</span>
