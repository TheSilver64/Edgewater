The rope ladder is unusable, but the oak's lower branches form natural steps. Your adult strength and lengthy limbs allow you to climb with ease. 

Inside, the treehouse is smaller than you remember. Child-sized, barely large enough for you to crouch. Spiderwebs stretch across the corners, their gossamer filaments catching the last few rays of light like rain barrels in a drizzle. The floor is littered with pine needles and the skeletal wisps of leaves.

And there, half-buried beneath the debris—

Your breath catches.

A toy. Your toy. A small wooden plane you'd assembled from balsa wood, painted red and white in careful stripes. You'd spent hours on the details, on getting the proportions mathematically correct so the pieces slide snugly into place.

You pick it up. The wood is gray with age, splintered in places. But its weight in your hands is familiar. You can never forget the satisfaction of constructing something tangible that occupies three-dimensional space alongside you.

[[The memory surfaces like something dredged from the murky silt of the lakefloor:->Ch5Pg2A4]]
