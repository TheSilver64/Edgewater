A single rose bush remains standing. It's not blooming–wrong season–but it's not fully dead, either. The stems are gray, the thorns like claws, but somewhere, deep in its core, a thread of life persists.You can see it in the faint red sheen beneath the bark, in the way the branches haven't yet become brittle enough to snap.

Your mother's rose. The one she planted. 

How long ago was it?
