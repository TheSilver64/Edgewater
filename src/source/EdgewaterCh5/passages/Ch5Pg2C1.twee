A group of teenagers carry canoes out of a small boathouse nearby, guided by a young Black man in his twenties. As the teens head onto the water, their instructor notices you and waves. He jogs over.

<span class="alexander">"Hey there. You must be Arthur Hepburn."</span> his voice carries the distinctive Yooper accent that marks someone born and raised in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. His hat is bleached almost white from sun and lake water, its brim frayed. 

He extends his hand. You shake it after some hesitation, caught off guard. <span class="arthur">“How’d you know?”</span>

<span class="alexander">"Small town. News travels fast."</span> He grins. <span class="alexander">"Plus, nobody lives on this side of town but you guys. Means the water's less crowded."</span>

He turns and yells to the group of paddling teens. <span class="alexander">"Free paddle for the next half hour!"</span>

The teens let out a cheer.

<span class="alexander">"Sorry, forgot about introductions. I'm Alexander Wyatt. I'm really sorry about your dad."</span>

<span class="arthur">"Thanks,"</span> you manage. <span class="arthur">"What's with the canoes?"</span>

<span class="alexander">"I'm a canoeing instructor, run classes for the kids. Trying to keep the recreation business alive. My family–or my mom’s family, I should say–has been on this lake for generations."</span> He pauses, studying you. <span class="alexander">"Not as long as yours, though."</span>

You feel a familiar defensive instinct rise. <span class="arthur">"Hepburn tradition doesn't mean much anymore."</span>

Alexander shakes his head. <span class="alexander">"I meant your mother's people. The Menominee connection to this place runs deep."</span>

The mention catches you off guard. [[“You know about that?”->Ch5Pg2C2]]</span><</type>>
