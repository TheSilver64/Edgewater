The winding highway stretches before you. You hold the steering wheel at ten and two, your grip so tight your knuckles blanch white. 

The rental car smells of industrial air freshener, its interior impeccable save for your duffle bag slumped in the passenger seat. You packed it methodically–a few changes of clothes, toiletries, and your laptop. As for your funeral attire, you’re already wearing it: a pressed black suit slightly too large for your frame. The suit from the last funeral you attended no longer fits anymore. 

You drove through the night, across Wisconsin, up into the little neck of the woods you used to call home.
