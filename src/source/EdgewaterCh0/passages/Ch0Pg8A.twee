A sharp cry awakens you. You hear a thump and a thud. Your eyes fly open. Your room is pitch black. The sky is obscured by brewing stormclouds. They rumble, a low deep sound that penetrates the floorboards. But that wasn’t the sound that woke you up–that noise is coming from downstairs.

You peel off your blankets and slip out of your room. You tiptoe barefoot across the hallway and down the stairs. One step at a time, quietly, delicately. One wrong movement and the groans of the old house’s bones would alert your parents.

The sound is coming from their room at the foot of the stairs.

Another cry–loud, piercing. In pain. Agonizing. More thumps. 

Your father’s voice–low, angry. Then desperate, pleading.

[[You peek through the banister. -> Ch0Pg9A]]
