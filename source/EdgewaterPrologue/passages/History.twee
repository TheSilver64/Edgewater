“Come over here,” your mother says to Winona, patting the space between her legs. 
She holds up a brush with several colorful hairbands tied around the handle. 
“Let me braid your hair while I tell it to you.”

Winona hesitates, fear flashing across her face for a moment–the fear of the pain of tangles.

“One story is about the land and our connection to it, and one story is about our people and our survival. 
Both are true. Both are important.” She looks at you, and her dark brown eyes catch the moonlight, shining almost like amber. 
“So Arthur, which story do you want to hear tonight? Which truth do you need?”
